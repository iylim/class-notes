# Post-Graduation Training

Congratulations! You are all now officially consultants; however, your learning is not over.
You should continue to level up your skills over the next few weeks/months on the bench.

I have put together this list of technologies and resources that are hot in the tech world right now.
You may proceed through these lessons at any pace you want.
This list is meant to guide your learning, but feel free to go off on any tangents that interest you.
If you start learning GraphQL and get inspired to build an API for beer, then by all means follow that interest.
In fact, I would recommend trying to build something (it can be small) with every technology you learn.

The most important part of learning is to stay curious and passionate.

### Testing React Applications

There are many, many ways to test code, and many ways to test React applications specifically.

One of the most popular methods uses Jest with Enzyme.

[Jest](https://jestjs.io/) is a JavaScript unit testing framework, used by Facebook to test services and React applications.

[Enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/) is a JavaScript Testing utility built by AirBnB for React that makes it easier to assert, manipulate, and traverse your React Componentsâ€™ output.

First, work through the [Jest Getting Started Docs](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started.html) to familiarize yourself with Jest.
Then, follow this tutorial on [Testing React with Jest and Enzyme](https://medium.com/codeclan/testing-react-with-jest-and-enzyme-20505fec4675)

### CSS Preprocessors

> A CSS preprocessor is a program that lets you generate CSS from the preprocessor's own unique syntax.
> There are many CSS preprocessors to choose from, however most CSS preprocessors will add some features that don't exist in pure CSS, such as mixin, nesting selector, inheritance selector, and so on.
> These features make the CSS structure more readable and easier to maintain.

The most popular CSS preprocessors are:

- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [Less](http://lesscss.org/)
- [Stylus](http://stylus-lang.com/)
- [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/)

My favorites are Sass and Stylus.

Learn one of these and then try to refactor some CSS in an existing project.
