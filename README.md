## Week 1

### Technologies

Compiled a list of web technologies we are familiar with.
Broke that list down into __core__ technologies that we will learn in this class,
ones we will be __exposed__ to, and technologies that are __tangential__ to what we are learning.

### Current Events
* [Google Wants to Kill the URL](https://www.wired.com/story/google-wants-to-kill-the-url/)
* [Google Takes its First Steps Towards Killing the URL](https://www.wired.com/story/google-chrome-kill-url-first-steps/)

### How the Web Works

* __Wires, WIFI, and Satellite transmissions__ carry all of our data around the world.
* __Assets__ including code files such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as images, video, music, etc.
* __Servers__ store the assets and serve them up to any who requests them.
* __Clients__ are the ones who request assets.
* __TCP__, otherwise known as __Transmission Control Protocol__, defines how applications can create channels of communication across a network and manages how a message is assembled into smaller packets.
* __IP__, otherwise known as __Internet Protocol__, defines how to address and route each packet to make sure it reaches the right destination.
* __DNS__, otherwise known as __Domain Name System__, is how devices translate human-readable _domain names_ to computer-readable IP addresses.
* __HTTP__, or the HyperText Transfer Protocol, is the application protocol that defines how devices speak to each other and send/request assets.
