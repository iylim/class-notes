## Week 1

### Technologies

Compiled a list of web technologies we are familiar with.
Broke that list down into **core** technologies that we will learn in this class,
ones we will be **exposed** to, and technologies that are **tangential** to what we are learning.

### Current Events

- [Google Wants to Kill the URL](https://www.wired.com/story/google-wants-to-kill-the-url/)
- [Google Takes its First Steps Towards Killing the URL](https://www.wired.com/story/google-chrome-kill-url-first-steps/)

### How the Web Works

- **Wires, WIFI, and Satellite transmissions** carry all of our data around the world.
- **Assets** including code files such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as images, video, music, etc.
- **Servers** store the assets and serve them up to any who requests them.
- **Clients** are the ones who request assets.
- **TCP**, otherwise known as **Transmission Control Protocol**, defines how applications can create channels of communication across a network and manages how a message is assembled into smaller packets.
- **IP**, otherwise known as **Internet Protocol**, defines how to address and route each packet to make sure it reaches the right destination.
- **DNS**, otherwise known as **Domain Name System**, is how devices translate human-readable _domain names_ to computer-readable IP addresses.
- **HTTP**, or the HyperText Transfer Protocol, is the application protocol that defines how devices speak to each other and send/request assets.

### Example: Serving a Static Site

- DigitalOcean
- Ubuntu
- Nginx Server
- Google Domains
- Filezilla
- HTML5

### HTML

Make sure to use semantic elements whenever possible. Avoid "div soup".
![divs vs good markups](http://v1c2v4d1fl-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/semantic.jpg)
Some HTML5 semantic elements include:

- `<header>`- Defines a header for a document or a section
- `<nav>` - Defines a container for navigation links
- `<section>` - Defines a section in a document
- `<article>` - Defines an independent self-contained article
- `<aside>` - Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar)
- `<footer>` - Defines a footer for a document or a section
- `<details>` - Defines additional details
- `<summary>` - Defines a heading for the `<details>` element
